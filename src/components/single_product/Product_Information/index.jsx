        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
          The CeraVe Ceramides Moisturising Cream for Dry Skin is a specially
          formulated skincare product designed to replenish dry to very dry
          skin. Developed by dermatologists, it is enriched with essential
          components such as ceramides and hyaluronic acid, which deeply hydrate
          the skin and maintain its health and quality.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
          What makes the CeraVe Moisturising Cream unique is its patented MVE
          technology that ensures a continuous release of hydration throughout
          the day, providing 24-hour moisturisation. This innovative technology
          and the combination of ingredients, protects your skin's natural
          barrier against environmental aggressors, resulting in a significant
          improvement in your skin's health and quality.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
          CeraVe Moisturising Cream is a non-comedogenic product that is
          suitable for use on both the face and body. It does not block pores or
          cause breakouts, making it an ideal choice to hydrate the skin. The
          fragrance-free formula of this cream reduces the risk of skin
          irritation, making it suitable for people with sensitive skin.
